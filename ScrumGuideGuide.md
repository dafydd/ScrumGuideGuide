# quick facts
time boxes:
- 1 cal. mo - Sprint
- 15 min - Daily Scrum
- 4 hr - Sprint Review
- 3 hr - Sprint Retrospective

pillars (TIA):
1. Transparency
2. Inspection
3. Adaptability

values (CCFOR):
1. Comittment
2. Courage
3. Focus
4. Openness
5. Respect

# purpose
- for developing, delivering and sustaining complex products

# definition
- Def. "A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value."
- lightweight
- simple to understand
- difficult to master

- A _process framework_
- not a process, techique or definitive method
- it's a _framework_

- makes _relative efficacy_ of product management and work techniques visible
- ... for continuous improvement
- Scrum = teams + roles + events + artifacts + rules
- tactics for scrum vary (described elsewhere)

# uses of
- originally for managing and developing products
- but now used for all kinds of things
- for interative and incremental knowledge transfer
- small team of people
- single, several, many, networks of teams...
- "develop" and "development" can refer to more than just "dev" work

# theory
- empirical process theory (knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known)
- iterative, incremental approach to optimise predictability and control risk

## pillars:

## 1 - transparency
- must be visible to people responsible for outcome
- common standard for observers have common understanding e.g. Def. of Done

## 2 - inspection
- frequently inspect artifacts and progress to Sprint Goal
- not so frequently is distracting
- best when dilligently performed by _skilled inspectors at point of work_

## 3 - adaptation
- adjustments when deviation outside acceptable limits found
- made _ASAP_ minimizing further deviation
- 4 formal events for inspect & adapt:
   - sprint planning
   - daily scrum
   - sprint review
   - sprint retrospective

# values
1. Commitment
2. Courage
3. Focus - everyone focuses on the Sprint & goals of Team
4. Openness
5. Respect - Team members respect each other as capable, independent people

# team
- Team = Product Owner + Dev Team + Scrum Master
- self-organizing (Team decides for itself how to do the work not outsiders.)
- cross-functional (All competencies needed are in team.)
- iterative and incremental deliveries -> potentially useful working product is always available

## PO
- responsible: maximising value of the product of the Dev Team
- how to do this varies
- **sole person** responsible for managing Product Backlog
  - clearly expressing **Product Backlog Items (PBIs)**
  - ordering BPIs to achieve goals
  - optimizing value of work of Dev team
  - ensure Product Backlog is visible, transparent and clear, and what Team will work on next
  - ensure Dev Team understands PBIs
- doesn't have to do it personally, but is **accountable for it**
- is **one person** not a committee
- org must respect the PO
- nobody can force Dev Team to work from different requirements

## Devs
- develop potentially releaseable increment of "Done" product per Sprint
- "Done" increment required at Sprint Review
- only Dev Team create the increment
- structured & empowered to manage their own work

characteristics:
- are self-organising (nobody tells Dev Team how to turn PBIs into releasable product increment)
- cross-functional with all skills needed
- Scrum recognises no Dev Team titles regardless of work done
- no sub-teams recognised
- individuals may have specialised skills & focus but **accountability is per whole Dev Team**

## Scrum Mastah
- responsible for promoting & supporting Scrum as defined in Guide
- help everyone understand Scrum Theory, practices, rules & values
- servant leader
- help people outside Scrum Team understand helpful/non-helpful interactions with Scrum Team
- helps to change interactions to maximise value produced

### helps PO:
- ensure goals, scope, product domain are understood by Scrum Team
- techniques for backlog management
- help Scrum Team understand need for clear, concise PBIs
- understand product planning in empirical environment
- ensure PO knows how to arrange backlog to maximise value
- understanding & practising agility
- facilitating Scrum Events as needed/requested

### helps Dev Team
- coaching Dev Team in self-organisation/X-functionality
- help create high-value products
- remove impediments
- facilitating Scrum Events as requested/needed
- coaching Dev Team in orgs where Scrum not fully adopted/understood

### helps Org
- leading/coaching Scrum adoption
- planning Scrum implementation in Org
- help employees & stakeholders understand & enact Scrum & empirical product development
- causing change to increase productivity of Scrum Team
- working with other Scrum Masters to increase effectiveness of Scrum in the Org

# Events
- all time-boxed
- all bar sprint are an opportunity for inspect & adapt
- failure to include the events -> less transparency & inspect-adapt opportunities

## Sprint
- time-box of 1 calendar month or less
- consistent durations
- "Done", usable, potentially releasable product increment created for each Sprint
- new one starts immediately on completion
- Sprint contains
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Scrums
  - Dev Work
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- During:
  - no changes endangering Sprint Goal
  - quality doesn't decrease
  - scope can be clarified/renegotiated between PO and Dev Team
- has a goal, design & flexible plan
- when Sprint length too long:
  - defn. of work may change
  - complexity could rise
  - risk could increase
- enable predictability - inspect & adapt at least at monthly granularity
- bound cost to 1 calendar month

### Sprint cancelling
- can be cancelled 
  - only by PO (but can be influenced by others)
  - if Sprint Goals is obsolete
  - should happen if Sprint Goal no longer makes sense in circumstances
  - short duration -> rarely need to cancel
- when cancelled:
  - completed & "Done" PBIs reviewed
  - if potentially releasable PO accepts the PBI
  - incomplete items re-estimated & returned to Product Backlog
  - often costly & traumatic and uncommon

## Sprint Planning
- entire Scrum Team plans
- time-boxed 8 hours max for 1 month Sprint
- Scrum Master:
  - ensures planning takes place
  - people understand what's happening
  - within time-box

planning questions:
- What can be delivered in Sprint?
  - inputs: product backlog, latest product increment. projected Dev Team capacity, past perf,
  - number of items **soley** up to Dev Team
  - **only Dev Team assesses what it can accomplish** in Sprint
  - Scrum Team creates Sprint Goal - provides guidance on why doing the Product Increment
- How will work be achieved?
  - Dev Team decide how to build functionality to "Done" Increment
  - "Sprint Backlog" = PBIs selected for Sprint + plan for delivering them
  - work decomposed by end of planning
  - ... often to units <= 1 day
  - Dev Team self-organises during Sprint Planning & rest of Sprint
- PO clarifies & makes trade-offs
- too much/too little work -> Dev Team can renegotiate with PO
- Dev Team can invite other tech/domain experts for advice
- by end of Sprint Planning - Dev Team should be able to explain how to create the Product Increment

Sprint Goal
- guidance to why it's being built
- created during Sprint Planning
- gives Dev Team flexibiliy on implementation
- BPIs are **one coherent function**
- Sprint Goal - any coherence causing Dev Team to work together 

## Daily Scrum
- timeboxed to 15 mins
- every day
- plan next day's work
- inspect & adapt last day's work & forecast upcoming Sprint
- held same time & place daily
- structure set by Dev Team 
- typically: what done? what will I do today? any implediments seen?
- Dev Team often meet after Daily Scrum for detailed discussion/replan
- Scrum Master is responsible for 
  - ensuring the Daily Scrum happens
  - enforcing the 15 minute time-box
- Dev Team is responsible for conducting the meeting


## Sprint Review
- time-boxed to 4 hours for 1 month Sprint
- Scrum Master responsible for 
  - holding
  - enforcing time-box
  - ensuring everyone understands purpose of meeting
- attendees:
- stakeholders invited by PO
- Scrum Team
- result: revised Product Backlog

## Sprint Retrospective
- time-boxed to 3 hours for 1 month Sprint
- Scrum Master responsible for 
  - holding it
  - it is productive & positive
  - enforcing time-box
- Scrum Master participates as team peer - w/ accountability over process

purpose
- inspect last Sprint re: people, relationships, process & tools
- identify & order major items - went well, potential improvements
- plan for implementing improvements to Scrum Team ways of working

- improvements can take place at any point but Sprint Retrospective is a formal opportunity for this

# Scrum Artifacts
- to maximise transparency & inspect-adapt opportunities
- to share common understanding of artifact

## Product Backlog
- ordered list of everything needed in product
- single source of requirements for changes
- PO is responsible for it, incl. content, availability, ordering
- it's never complete - evolves & is dynamic
- all features, fixes, functions, requirements and enhancements
- PBIs have: description, order, estimate, value
- often PBIs have test descriptions to define "Done" 

- PO and Dev Team collaborate on details of PBIs
- Scrum Team decides how and when refinement done
- refinement should consume <= 10% capacity of Dev Team
- PBIs closer to being done are more clearer and more detailed
- PBIs that can be "Done" by Dev Team -> "Ready" for Sprint Planning selection
- Dev Team responsible for all estimates (people doing work decide the final estimate)

## Sprint Backlog
- Sprint Backlog = set of PBIs selected for Sprint + plan for delivery of Product Increment & getting to Sprint Goal
- is forecast by Dev Team - what will be in the Product Increment + work needed to get it to "Done"
- makes visible all work necessary (per Dev Team) to meet Sprint Goal
- includes 1 >= process improvement from previous Sprint Retrospective
- is a plan with enough detail changes in progress can be understood in Daily Scrum
- modified continuously through Sprint by Dev Team
  - new work is added to Sprint Backlog as found
  - completed or found unnecessary remaining work is updated
- only Dev Team can change Sprint Backlog
- is highly visible, real-time picture of work Dev Team plans to do in Sprint
- ... belongs soley to Dev Team

Monitoring Progress
- total work remaining can be summed at all times in Sprint
- Dev Team tracks total worked remaining - at least per Daily Scrum
- ... likelihood of meeting Sprint Goal
- by tracking remaining work can manage progress

## Increment
- Product Increment = sum of all PBIs completed during a Sprint & value of the increments all all previous Sprints
- at end of Sprint, new Increment must be "Done"
- "Done" = in usable condition & meet Scrum Team's definition of "Done"
- a body of inspectable, done work supporting empiricism at Sprint end
- a step towards a vision or goal
- must be in usable condition even if PO doesn't want to release it

# Artifact Transparency
- value optimisation and control risk - based on seen state of artifacts
- transparency affects soundness of these decisions
- decisions can be flawed due to incomplete transparency -> diminish value & increase risk
- Scrum Master works to
  - ensure transparency 
  - provide practices for dealing with incomplete transparency
  - help to apply the most appropriate practices by sensing patterns, lisenting, detecting differences real vs expected results
  - Scrum Master's job to increase transparency
- transparency is a path not instant result

## “Done”
- must be a common Scrum Team definition
- everybody must understand it
- ensures transparency
- guides Dev Team to decide how many PBIs can be selected in Sprint Planning
- Sprint purpose = deliver Increments of potentially releasable fuctionality meeting "Done"
- must deliver Product Increments each Sprint
- Organisation definiton of "Done" 
  - forms minimum standard for Scrum Teams
  - if not defined, Team must define a "Done" def.
- multiple Scrum Teams on same product? -> must mutually define "Done"
- each Product Increment is additive to prior ones - all working together
- "Done" def is expected to change over time 
- Any product should have a standard of "Done" that's appropriate for it

# End Notes
- only implementing all the roles, events, artifacts and rules makes Scrum
- you can implement parts but that doesn't meet the definition of "Scrum"
